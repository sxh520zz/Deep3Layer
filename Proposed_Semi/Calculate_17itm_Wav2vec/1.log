Some weights of the model checkpoint at /mnt/data1/liyongwei/SSL_Models/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2Model: ['lm_head.weight', 'lm_head.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2Model from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2Model from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2Model were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /mnt/data1/liyongwei/SSL_Models/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h and are newly initialized: ['wav2vec2.masked_spec_embed']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
